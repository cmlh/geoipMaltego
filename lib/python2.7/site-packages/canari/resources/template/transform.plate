The @configure decorator tells mtginstall how to install the transform in Maltego. It takes the following parameters:
    - label:        the name of the transform as it appears in the Maltego UI transform selection menu
    - description:  a short description of the transform
    - uuids:        a list of unique transform IDs, one per input type. The order of this list must match that of the 
                    inputs parameter. Make sure you account for entity type inheritance in Maltego. For example, if you
                    choose a DNSName entity type as your input type you do not need to specify it again for MXRecord, 
                    NSRecord, etc.
    - inputs:       a list of tuples where the first item is the name of the transform set the transform should be part
                    of, and the second item is the input entity type.
    - debug:        Whether or not the debugging window should appear in Maltego's UI when running the transform.
TODO: set the appropriate configuration parameters for your transform.
